## Key Features

### Five Specialized Agents

- **Sentinel (Morgan)** - Code review, security analysis, architecture oversight
- **Conversion Architect (Avery)** - UX & growth design, Apple HIG expertise
- **Docs Engineer (Sam)** - Clear, accurate, shippable documentation
- **Docs Architect (Emerson)** - Narrative-driven, award-worthy docs
- **Systems Thinker (Jan)** - Deep problem solving, first-principles thinking

### Enterprise Best Practices

Your projects get instant access to:

- **AGENTS.md** - Code quality standards, architecture patterns, testing requirements
- **CLAUDE.md** - Project-specific patterns and workspace context
- **AGENT-WORKSPACE.md** - Template for workspace-specific information

### Safe Updates

The migration system ensures smooth upgrades:

- Idempotent migrations
- Automatic execution on `ai update`
- Rollback support with `ai migrate down`
- Clear migration status with `ai migrate status`

## Philosophy

AI Dev Tools embodies five core principles:

1. **Explicit Over Implicit** - Every decision has a clear rationale
2. **Fail Fast, Fail Loud** - No silent failures or degraded modes
3. **Optimize for Deletion** - Code that doesn't exist can't break
4. **Trust Nothing, Verify Everything** - Type systems prevent bugs, runtime checks prevent disasters
5. **Critical Thinking Over Agreement** - Challenge assumptions, question solutions
