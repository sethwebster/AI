# Installation

Get AI Dev Tools installed and configured in your development environment.

## Quick Install (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started:

```bash
npx @sethwebster/ai-cli
```

Or install globally:

```bash
npm install -g @sethwebster/ai-cli
```

This automatically:
1. Downloads the `ai` function
2. Adds it to your shell config (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
3. Makes it available immediately

## Alternative: Direct Install

If you prefer not to use npm:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sethwebster/AI/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Manual Installation

If you prefer manual setup:

### Step 1: Download the Function

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sethwebster/AI/main/ai-function.sh >> ~/.zshrc
```

For bash users, replace `~/.zshrc` with `~/.bashrc`.

### Step 2: Reload Your Shell

```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

```bash
ai version
```

You should see the AI Dev Tools version and logo.

## Initialize a Project

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
ai init
```

This creates:

- **AGENTS.md** - Symlinked to latest best practices
- **CLAUDE.md** - Symlinked to project guidelines
- **AGENT-WORKSPACE.md** - Template for project-specific context

The symlinks ensure you always have the latest guidelines via `ai update`.

## Install Agents

Install specialized agents to Claude Code or Codex:

```bash
ai install agents
```

You'll be prompted to:

1. Select which agents to install (or choose "all")
2. Choose installation location:
   - **Project-level** (.claude/agents/ or .codex/skills/) - Shared with team via git
   - **User-level** (~/.claude/agents/ or ~/.codex/skills/) - Personal only, all projects

## Supported Tools

AI Dev Tools works with:

- **Claude Code** - Anthropic's official CLI
- **Codex** - Alternative AI coding tool

The installer detects installed tools automatically.

## What Gets Installed?

### Shell Function

The `ai` command is added to your shell config with these capabilities:

- Initialize projects (`ai init`)
- Install agents (`ai install agents`)
- Update local repo (`ai update`)
- Run migrations (`ai migrate`)
- Manage registry (`ai list`, `ai forget`)

### Local Repository

A shallow clone is created at `~/.ai-repo-local-clone`:

- Depth 1 (latest commit only)
- No .git directory (saves space)
- Updated via `ai update`

### Registry

Initialized directories are tracked in `~/.ai-registry`:

- Plain text file (one path per line)
- Enables bulk updates with `ai update-all`
- Remove with `ai forget`

## Directory Structure

After `ai init`, your project has:

```
your-project/
├── AGENTS.md           → ~/.ai-repo-local-clone/AGENTS.md (symlink)
├── CLAUDE.md           → ~/.ai-repo-local-clone/CLAUDE.md (symlink)
└── AGENT-WORKSPACE.md  (copy, customize this)
```

## Shell Compatibility

Supported shells:

- **zsh** (macOS default)
- **bash** (Linux default, older macOS)

The installer detects your shell automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found

If `ai` is not recognized after installation:

```bash
# Reload your shell
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc

# Verify the function is loaded
type ai
```

### Symlink warnings

If `ai init` warns about existing files:

- **Already a symlink** - No action needed, you're up to date
- **Regular file exists** - You'll be prompted to replace it with a symlink

### Permission denied

If you get permission errors:

```bash
# Make the function executable
chmod +x ~/.ai-repo-local-clone/ai-function.sh

# Try the installation again
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Uninstallation

To remove AI Dev Tools:

### Remove Shell Function

Edit your shell config (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc) and delete the section:

```bash
# AI Development CLI
ai() {
  # ... (entire function)
}
```

### Remove Local Repository

```bash
rm -rf ~/.ai-repo-local-clone
```

### Remove Registry

```bash
rm ~/.ai-registry
rm ~/.ai-migration-state
```

### Remove Agents

For project-level:
```bash
rm -rf .claude/agents/*
rm -rf .codex/skills/*
```

For user-level:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/agents/*
rm -rf ~/.codex/skills/*
```
